## The Best Java-Toolkit for Cross-Platform Development of Native Mobile Apps

_The proven Tabris for Eclipse RAP is a Java framework written by Java developers for Java developers to build mobile apps._

Tabris Apps combine an Eclipse RAP based backend with a native mobile client frontend. It allows developers to enjoy all advantages they are used from working in Java, as well as reusing existing code from Eclipse RAP or RCP applications. While Tabris Apps require a connection to the server to work, they can easily be updated by installing new application versions on the server, without the need to update the apps on the mobile devices.

The main advantages of Tabris based Apps are security and development cost. New mobile apps can be implemented easily on both iOS and Android, without the need to employ experts for native mobile platforms. With Tabris for Eclipse RAP, existing Java and RAP know-how is sufficient to implement mobile apps on multiple platforms, with a native look and feel.

### How does it work?

Tabris for Eclipse RAP uses standard JavaEE technology to create an application on a server. Native clients act as a player for the applicationsâ€™ UI. They access the application by calling a URL that provides a [JSON](https://json.org/) representation of the UI. The clients will use this JSON message to render the UI using native components. Native components are Cocoa Touch widgets in iOS, Java-based widgets in Android and HTML5 in a browser.

Tabris for Eclipse RAP is compatible with all RAP 3.x versions, but it is highly recommended to match RAP version.

With the new RAP on Tabris Launcher App, you can now test your existing application without building it.

### Secure Mobile Apps for Business

Mobile devices impose a security risk for sensitive data as they are easily lost or stolen. Storing data physically on the device is a risk. With Tabris for Eclipse RAP there is no data stored on the device and the data sent to the client is encrypted using approved technologies like HTTPS. Your data remains safe on your servers.

[Open Source Server Parts](https://www.eclipse.org/rap/) use standard servlet technology and run on any JEE servlet container. It integrates well with OSGi and other Eclipse technologies like [Equinox](https://eclipse.org/equinox/), [EMF](https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/), [Birt](https://eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/), [CDO](https://eclipse.org/cdo/), [EclipseLink](https://eclipse.org/eclipselink/), [Virgo](https://eclipse.org/virgo/), and others. If you have any business logic written in Java it is easy to integrate it into your mobile applications.

### Powerful User interfaces

Tabris for Eclipse RAP  provides a powerful widget toolkit that renders native iOS and Android widgets. It is based on a proven technology stack using [SWT](https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT), [JFace](https://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFace), and [OSGi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi). You can write your application entirely in Java, re-use existing code and benefit from [first-class IDE tools](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcp-and-rap-developers/keplerr) without the need for cross-compiling.

Using [JFace](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace) APIs makes accessing complex data models incredibly simple. [JFace Data Binding](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace_Data_Binding) allows you to attach data to your widgets without tight coupling. Virtual Trees and Tables provide you with full control to push only the data that is needed to the client, just in time.
