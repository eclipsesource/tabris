## Download Tabris for Eclipse RAP 3.17

Tabris for Eclipse RAP downloads provide two components: a target platform for your server-side code, and Apps for App / Play Store. To get started you can use our standard mobile app from the stores, when publishing your own apps you can build apps with your own name and theme with our build service.

### Eclipse target platform components

To develop Tabris for Eclipse RAP applications you need to set a target platform that contains Tabris and RAP. We provide a target platform that contains RAP, Equinox, Jetty, and everything you need to run a RAP application. Learn how to work with the target platform.
