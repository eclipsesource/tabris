## Deploying Launchers

Deploying the launchers means deploying the .ipk file on Android and the .ipa file on iOS. We do not restrict how those files are deployed. You can use every possible way. This means you can either submit the apps to a store or use them for adhoc deployment. Below you will find some links that may help you deploy the launchers.
