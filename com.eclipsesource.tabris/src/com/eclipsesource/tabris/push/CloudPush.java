 * {@link CloudPush} is a {@link ClientService} implementation and can be obtained by calling
 * <code>RWT.getClient().getService( CloudPush.class );</code>. A {@link CloudPush} instance can be used to register
 * a client to receive push notifications by simply adding a {@link CloudPushListener}. This instructs the client to
 * register itself once at the push service that is common for the client platform.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After a client is registered to receive notifications the {@link CloudPush} service notifies all attached
 * {@link CloudPushListener} if a registration, message or error was received.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After a message was pushed to the client it forwards the message to the server. This message can be obtained by
 * calling {@link CloudPush#getMessage()}.
